# Pitch
Wunderlist 2.0 takes your traditional to-do list app and automates it. It not only allows you to write your to-do, work, grocery, trip and household lists, but allows you to set up recurring to do lists by date and time. (Think recurring events on google calendar + to-do list app). 

No matter how much is on your plate, Wunderlist 2.0 makes it super easy to remember all the little recurring to-dos and surprise to-dos that pop up unexpectedly.
   
# Teammate Contributions
## Ryan Plante
Participated in standup, making sure all needs were vocalized and relayed to the Brandon and Jeremiah, as well as, getting what they needed done from me. Gave some input as to what our site should look like, but otherwise gave Brandon free reign as to how the app should look.
### axiosWithAuth
Simple Authorization setting token to localStorage and adding it in all componenets that required editing, adding, or deleting.
### LoginForm 
Added the post request to both Sign-Up and Login, allowing the user access their lists
### PrivateRoute 
Just used in the App file. Makes sure user as required token to access lists. Otherwise, Routes them back to login.
### Task, To Do Form, Edit Task and To Do Form 
Added post, edit, and delete functions so user can add a task or a to do, using mindful states that made sense for each component.
